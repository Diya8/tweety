## Workflow

### Fetch User Tweets

Recent tweets of the user are fetched using the Twitter API through tweepy Python library.

### Sentiment Analysis

The text from tweet is cleaned and analysed is classified as positive, neutral or negative using TextBlob python library. The total percentage of positive, negative and neutral tweets are calculated. These results are stored for further use.

### Journaling

We provide a journal option to vent out your thoughts.

### Recommendations

Based on the highest percentage of sentiment, movies are recommended to the user. This is implemented through web scraping.

### Challenges

Users are provided challenges for personal development. Completion of a challenge leaves the user with a sense of accomplishment and a tweet is automatically sent out from their account celebrating this.

### Prolonged Negative Emotions

If a user is experiencing prolonged negative emotions:
- Tweets are sent out to their chosen contacts asking them to check up on them.
- Mental Health resources compiled from Twitter are provided to the user.
